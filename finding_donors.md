## Supervised Learning
## Project: Finding Donors for *CharityML*

## Getting Started

In this project, I will employ several supervised algorithms of my choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. My goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. 

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

## Exploring the Data
The code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the census data. Note that the last column from this dataset, `'income'`, will be our target label (whether an individual makes more than, or at most, $50,000 annually). All other columns are features about each individual in the census database.

### Implementation: Data Exploration
A cursory investigation of the dataset will determine how many individuals fit into either group, and will tell us about the percentage of these individuals making more than \$50,000. In the code cell below, I will need to compute the following:
- The total number of records, `'n_records'`
- The number of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'n_greater_50k'`.
- The number of individuals making at most \$50,000 annually, `'n_at_most_50k'`.
- The percentage of individuals making more than \$50,000 annually, `'greater_percent'`.
 


```python
# TODO: Total number of records
n_records = data.shape[0]

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is more than $50,000
n_greater_50k = len(data[data["income"] == ">50K"])

# TODO: Number of records where individual's income is at most $50,000
n_at_most_50k = len(data[data["income"] == "<=50K"])

# TODO: Percentage of individuals whose income is more than $50,000
greater_percent = (n_greater_50k / n_records) *100

# Print the results
print("Total number of records: {}".format(n_records))
print("Individuals making more than $50,000: {}".format(n_greater_50k))
print("Individuals making at most $50,000: {}".format(n_at_most_50k))
print("Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: {}%".format(greater_percent))
```

    Total number of records: 45222
    Individuals making more than $50,000: 11208
    Individuals making at most $50,000: 34014
    Percentage of individuals making more than $50,000: 24.78439697492371%

## Preparing the Data
Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured â€” this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms.

### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features
A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. 

The code cell below is to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed.


```python
# Split the data into features and target label
income_raw = data['income']
features_raw = data.drop('income', axis = 1)

# Visualize skewed continuous features of original data
vs.distribution(data)
```


![png](output_9_0.png)


For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.

The code cell below is to perform a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed. 


```python
# Log-transform the skewed features
skewed = ['capital-gain', 'capital-loss']
features_log_transformed = pd.DataFrame(data = features_raw)
features_log_transformed[skewed] = features_raw[skewed].apply(lambda x: np.log(x + 1))

# Visualize the new log distributions
vs.distribution(features_log_transformed, transformed = True)
```


![png](output_11_0.png)


### Normalizing Numerical Features
In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.

Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this.


```python
# Import sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize a scaler, then apply it to the features
scaler = MinMaxScaler() # default=(0, 1)
numerical = ['age', 'education-num', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss', 'hours-per-week']

features_log_minmax_transform = pd.DataFrame(data = features_log_transformed)
features_log_minmax_transform[numerical] = scaler.fit_transform(features_log_transformed[numerical])

# Show an example of a record with scaling applied
display(features_log_minmax_transform.head(n = 5))
```

### Implementation: Data Preprocessing

From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _"dummy"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.

|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |
| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |

Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label ("<=50K" and ">50K"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, I will need to implement the following:
 - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.
 - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.
   - Set records with "<=50K" to `0` and records with ">50K" to `1`.


```python
# TODO: One-hot encode the 'features_log_minmax_transform' data using pandas.get_dummies()
features_final = pd.get_dummies(features_log_minmax_transform)

# TODO: Encode the 'income_raw' data to numerical values
income = income_raw.replace({'<=50K': 0, '>50K': 1})

# Print the number of features after one-hot encoding
encoded = list(features_final.columns)
print("{} total features after one-hot encoding.".format(len(encoded)))

# Uncomment the following line to see the encoded feature names
# print encoded
```

    103 total features after one-hot encoding.


### Shuffle and Split Data
Now all _categorical variables_ have been converted into numerical features, and all numerical features have been normalized. As always, we will now split the data (both features and their labels) into training and test sets. 80% of the data will be used for training and 20% for testing.

Run the code cell below to perform this split.


```python
# Import train_test_split
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

# Split the 'features' and 'income' data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features_final, 
                                                    income, 
                                                    test_size = 0.2, 
                                                    random_state = 0)

# Show the results of the split
print("Training set has {} samples.".format(X_train.shape[0]))
print("Testing set has {} samples.".format(X_test.shape[0]))
```

    Training set has 36177 samples.
    Testing set has 9045 samples.

## Evaluating Model Performance
In this section, we will investigate four different algorithms, and determine which is best at modeling the data. 

### Metrics and the Naive Predictor
*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:

$$ F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\left( \beta^2 \cdot precision \right) + recall} $$

In particular, when $\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).

Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *"this person does not make more than \$50,000"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. 


#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall

** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. Itâ€™s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).

** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.
It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of

`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`

** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.
It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of

`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`

For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios).

### Question 1 - Naive Predictor Performace
* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset?


** HINT: ** 

* When we have a model that always predicts '1' (i.e. the individual makes more than 50k) then our model will have no True Negatives(TN) or False Negatives(FN) as we are not making any negative('0' value) predictions. Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. 
* Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives.


```python
TP = np.sum(income)
 # Counting the ones as this is the naive case. Note that 'income' is the 'income_raw' data 
#encoded to numerical values done in the data preprocessing step.
FP = income.count() - TP # Specific to the naive case

TN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case
FN = 0 # No predicted negatives in the naive case

# TODO: Calculate accuracy, precision and recall
accuracy = TP/ (TP+FP+TN+FN)
recall = TP / (TP+FN)
precision = TP / (TP+FP)

# TODO: Calculate F-score using the formula above for beta = 0.5 and correct values for precision and recall.
fscore = (1+ 0.5**2)* ((precision*recall)/(0.5**2*precision +recall))

# Print the results 
print("Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: {:.4f}, F-score: {:.4f}]".format(accuracy, fscore))
```

    Naive Predictor: [Accuracy score: 0.2478, F-score: 0.2917]


###  Supervised Learning Models
**The following are some of the supervised learning models that are currently available in** [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) **that I may choose from:**
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

### Question 2 - Model Application
List three of the supervised learning models above that are appropriate for this problem that I will test on the census data.

- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. 
- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?
- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?
- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?


**Answer: **

- **Decision Trees:**

Real-world application: Decision trees can be used in credit scoring, where the goal is to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on various factors such as income, employment history, and credit history.

Strengths: Decision trees are easy to understand and interpret, can handle both numerical and categorical data, and can capture non-linear relationships between features.

Weaknesses: Decision trees are prone to overfitting, especially when the tree becomes too deep or complex. They can also be sensitive to small changes in the data, leading to different tree structures.
Why it's a good candidate: Decision trees can handle both numerical and categorical features, which makes them suitable for the census data that contains a mix of both types of features. They can also provide insights into the most important features for predicting income. 

- **Random Forest:**

Real-world application: Random forests can be used in the field of bioinformatics to predict protein-protein interactions. By analyzing various features of proteins, random forests can predict whether two proteins will interact with each other or not.

Strengths: Random forests are robust to overfitting, can handle high-dimensional data, and can capture complex interactions between features. They also provide estimates of feature importance.

Weaknesses: Random forests can be computationally expensive and require more memory compared to simpler models. They can also be difficult to interpret compared to individual decision trees.
Why it's a good candidate: Random forests can handle high-dimensional data, which is suitable for the census data that contains many features. They can also capture complex interactions between features, which might be important for predicting income.

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**

Real-world application: SVMs can be used in image classification tasks, such as classifying images into different categories like cats, dogs, and cars. By representing images as feature vectors, SVMs can learn to separate different classes.

Strengths: SVMs can handle high-dimensional data, can capture complex relationships between features using different kernel functions, and are effective in cases where the number of features is larger than the number of samples.

Weaknesses: SVMs can be sensitive to the choice of kernel function and hyperparameters. They can also be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.
Why it's a good candidate: SVMs can handle high-dimensional data and capture complex relationships between features, which is suitable for the census data. They can also handle both numerical and categorical features by using appropriate kernel functions.

### Implementation: Initial Model Evaluation
In the code cell, I will need to implement the following:
- Import the three supervised learning models I've discussed in the previous section.
- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.
- Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.
  - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.


```python
# TODO: Import the three supervised learning models from sklearn
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# TODO: Initialize the three models
clf_A = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
clf_B = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
clf_C = SVC(random_state=42)

# TODO: Calculate the number of samples for 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data
# HINT: samples_100 is the entire training set i.e. len(y_train)
# HINT: samples_10 is 10% of samples_100 (ensure to set the count of the values to be `int` and not `float`)
# HINT: samples_1 is 1% of samples_100 (ensure to set the count of the values to be `int` and not `float`)
samples_100 = len(X_train)
samples_10 = int(len(X_train)*0.1)
samples_1 = int(len(X_train)*0.01)

# Collect results on the learners
results = {}
for clf in [clf_A, clf_B, clf_C]:
    clf_name = clf.__class__.__name__
    results[clf_name] = {}

## Improving Results
In this final section, I will choose from the three supervised learning models the *best* model to use on the student data. I will then perform a grid search optimization for the model over the entire training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) by tuning at least one parameter to improve upon the untuned model's F-score. 

### Question 3 - Choosing the Best Model

* Based on the evaluation I performed earlier, in one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML* which of the three models I believe to be most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals that make more than \$50,000. 

**Answer: **

Based on the evaluation performed earlier, the Random Forest model is the most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals who make more than $50,000. When 100% of the training data is used, the Random Forest model achieves the highest F-score on the testing set. The F-score is a metric that combines precision and recall, providing a balanced evaluation of the model's performance. In this case, the Random Forest model has the highest F-score, indicating a good balance between precision and recall.

In terms of prediction/training time, the Random Forest model is relatively fast compared to the other two models, Decision Trees and SVM. While it's important to note that the Random Forest model takes longer to train compared to Decision Trees, it still provides a reasonable training time considering the size of the dataset.

The Random Forest algorithm is well-suited for the data in this task. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. This algorithm is robust against overfitting and can handle both numerical and categorical features effectively. Additionally, Random Forest models can handle large datasets with high dimensionality, making it suitable for the CharityML dataset.

In summary, based on the evaluation results, the Random Forest model is the most appropriate choice for identifying individuals who make more than $50,000.

### Question 4 - Describing the Model in Layman's Terms

* In one to two paragraphs, explain to *CharityML*, in layman's terms, how the final model chosen is supposed to work. 

**Answer: ** 

The final model chosen, which is the Random Forest model, works by combining the predictions of multiple decision trees. The model is trained by giving it a dataset with information about individuals, such as their age, education, and occupation, along with whether they make more than $50,000 or not. The model then creates multiple decision trees, each using a random subset of the data and a random subset of the features. Each decision tree learns to make predictions based on different aspects of the data.
When it's time to make a prediction, each decision tree in the Random Forest model gives its own prediction. Then, the model takes the majority vote of all the decision trees to make the final prediction. This way, the model combines the knowledge of multiple decision trees to make a more accurate prediction.

The Random Forest model is powerful because it can handle different types of data and can handle large datasets. It is also robust against overfitting, which means it can generalize well to new, unseen data. By using this ensemble of decision trees, the Random Forest model provides a reliable and accurate way to predict whether an individual makes more than $50,000 or not.

### Implementation: Model Tuning
Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. I will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, I will need to implement the following:
- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).
- Initialize the classifier I've chosen and store it in `clf`.
 - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state I set before.
- Create a dictionary of parameters I wish to tune for the chosen model.
 - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.
 - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of my learner if that parameter is available!
- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\beta = 0.5$).
- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.
- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.



```python
# TODO: Import 'GridSearchCV', 'make_scorer', and any other necessary libraries
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
# TODO: Initialize the classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)

# TODO: Create the parameters list I wish to tune, using a dictionary if needed.
# HINT: parameters = {'parameter_1': [value1, value2], 'parameter_2': [value1, value2]}
parameters = {'n_estimators': [10, 50, 100, 200],
             'max_depth': [None, 5, 10, 20],
             'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
             'min_samples_leaf':[1, 2, 4]}

# TODO: Make an fbeta_score scoring object using make_scorer()
scorer = make_scorer(fbeta_score, beta = 0.5)

# TODO: Perform grid search on the classifier using 'scorer' as the scoring method using GridSearchCV()
grid_obj = GridSearchCV(clf, parameters, scoring = scorer )

# TODO: Fit the grid search object to the training data and find the optimal parameters using fit()
grid_fit = grid_obj.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Get the estimator
best_clf = grid_fit.best_estimator_

# Make predictions using the unoptimized and model
predictions = (clf.fit(X_train, y_train)).predict(X_test)
best_predictions = best_clf.predict(X_test)

# Report the before-and-afterscores
print("Unoptimized model\n------")
print("Accuracy score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)))
print("F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, predictions, beta = 0.5)))
print("\nOptimized Model\n------")
print("Final accuracy score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions)))
print("Final F-score on the testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5)))
```

    Unoptimized model
    ------
    Accuracy score on testing data: 0.8431
    F-score on testing data: 0.6842
    
    Optimized Model
    ------
    Final accuracy score on the testing data: 0.8593
    Final F-score on the testing data: 0.7309


### Question 5 - Final Model Evaluation

* What is my optimized model's accuracy and F-score on the testing data? 
* Are these scores better or worse than the unoptimized model? 
* How do the results from my optimized model compare to the naive predictor benchmarks I found earlier in **Question 1**?_  


#### Results:

|     Metric     | Unoptimized Model | Optimized Model |
| :------------: | :---------------: | :-------------: | 
| Accuracy Score |       0.8431      |    0.8593       |
| F-score        |       0.6842      |    0.7309       |


**Answer: ** 

The optimized model's accuracy on the testing data is 0.8593, and the F-score is 0.7309.

These scores are better than the unoptimized model. The accuracy increased from 0.8431 to 0.8593, and the F-score increased from 0.6842 to 0.7309. This indicates that the optimized model performs better in terms of both accuracy and the model's ability to balance precision and recall.

Comparing the results of the optimized model to the naive predictor benchmarks, we can see a significant improvement. The naive predictor had an accuracy score of 0.2478 and an F-score of 0.2917. The optimized model's accuracy and F-score are much higher, indicating that the optimized model is much more effective in predicting the income level than the naive predictor.

Overall, the optimized model shows improved performance compared to both the unoptimized model and the naive predictor benchmarks. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the hyperparameter tuning process in improving the model's predictive power.

## Feature Importance

An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \$50,000.

Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset.

### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation
When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do I believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would I rank them and why?

**Answer:**

Age: Age can be an important predictor as it often correlates with income and occupation. Younger individuals may be more likely to be students or have entry-level jobs, while older individuals may have more work experience and higher incomes.

Education Level: Education level is often a strong predictor of income and job opportunities. Higher levels of education may lead to higher-paying jobs and better career prospects.

Occupation: Occupation can provide insights into income levels and socioeconomic status. Different occupations have varying income ranges, and this information can be valuable for predicting income or other related outcomes.

Marital Status: Marital status can be an important factor as it may correlate with household income and financial stability. For example, married individuals may have dual incomes and potentially higher household incomes.

Capital Gain: Capital gain represents the profit made from selling assets such as stocks, real estate, or businesses. It can be a significant predictor of income and wealth, as individuals with higher capital gains may have more financial resources.

### Implementation - Extracting Feature Importance
Choose a `scikit-learn` supervised learning algorithm that has a `feature_importance_` attribute availble for it. This attribute is a function that ranks the importance of each feature when making predictions based on the chosen algorithm.



```python
# TODO: Import a supervised learning model that has 'feature_importances_'
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# TODO: Train the supervised model on the training set using .fit(X_train, y_train)
model = clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# TODO: Extract the feature importances using .feature_importances_ 
importances = clf.feature_importances_

# Plot
vs.feature_plot(importances, X_train, y_train)
```


![png](output_43_0.png)


### Question 7 - Extracting Feature Importance

Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above \$50,000.  


**Answer:**

* Comparing these results, we can see that age and marital-status are consistent with my initial thoughts. However, education-num, capital-gain, and hours-per-week differ from my initial list.

* The visualization of feature importances confirms that education-num and capital-gain are indeed important features for prediction. These features have higher weights, indicating their higher importance in the model. Although they were not on my initial list, the model has identified them as relevant features for predicting the income level.

* Hours-per-week is another feature that the model considers important, which was not on my initial list. This feature represents the number of hours an individual works per week and can provide insights into their income level.


### Feature Selection
How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower â€” at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model I found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. 


```python
# Import functionality for cloning a model
from sklearn.base import clone

# Reduce the feature space
X_train_reduced = X_train[X_train.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]
X_test_reduced = X_test[X_test.columns.values[(np.argsort(importances)[::-1])[:5]]]

# Train on the "best" model found from grid search earlier
clf = (clone(best_clf)).fit(X_train_reduced, y_train)

# Make new predictions
reduced_predictions = clf.predict(X_test_reduced)

# Report scores from the final model using both versions of data
print("Final Model trained on full data\n------")
print("Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, best_predictions)))
print("F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, best_predictions, beta = 0.5)))
print("\nFinal Model trained on reduced data\n------")
print("Accuracy on testing data: {:.4f}".format(accuracy_score(y_test, reduced_predictions)))
print("F-score on testing data: {:.4f}".format(fbeta_score(y_test, reduced_predictions, beta = 0.5)))
```

    Final Model trained on full data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8593
    F-score on testing data: 0.7309
    
    Final Model trained on reduced data
    ------
    Accuracy on testing data: 0.8469
    F-score on testing data: 0.6963


### Question 8 - Effects of Feature Selection

* How does the final model's F-score and accuracy score on the reduced data using only five features compare to those same scores when all features are used?
* If training time was a factor, would I consider using the reduced data as my training set?

**Answer:**

Final Model with All Features:

Accuracy score: This refers to the accuracy of the model in predicting the income level when using all available features.
F-score: This measures the model's ability to balance precision and recall when using all available features.


Final Model with Reduced Data (using only five features):

Accuracy score: This refers to the accuracy of the model in predicting the income level when using only the five selected features.
F-score: This measures the model's ability to balance precision and recall when using only the five selected features.
If training time was a factor, using the reduced data as the training set could be considered. By using only the five selected features, the model's training time can be significantly reduced compared to using all available features. This reduction in training time can be beneficial in scenarios where training time is a critical factor, such as when dealing with large datasets or limited computational resources.

Therefore, If training time is a critical factor and the decrease in performance is acceptable, using the reduced data can be a viable option. Otherwise, it might be preferable to use the complete feature set to maximize the model's predictive power.
